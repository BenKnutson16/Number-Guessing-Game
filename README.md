# Number-Guessing-Game
Treehouse Techdegree Project #1
This project is a game where the user tries to guess a random number between 1-10. The game will inform the user whether their guess is too high or too low. The game also keeps track of a high score which is the least number of guesses to get the right number.
This project was a great intro to the fundamentals of Python logic. It showcases my skills with functions, loops, conditionals, input, and output.
